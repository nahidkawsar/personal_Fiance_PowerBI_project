## Problem Statement


In this data analytics project, I have successfully constructed a personal finance dashboard using Power BI. The project proves beneficial for individuals aiming to monitor personal expenses, income, and financial goals. The utilized data is authentic, sourced directly from an individual.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : At the first page you will find the basic informations.For example the year wise income and expenses and so on.
- Step 4 : It was observed that When the income increased ,savings was less compared to expenses. 

- Step 5 : Ratings Visual was used to represent different ratings.
